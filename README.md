### Hi there, I'm Devyani! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an engineer by profession and a programmer by passion!
I have always been intrigued with programming and the way computers and their applications work. I was told the best way to learn it is a CS degree and here I am, a third-year Computer Engineering undergraduate student at TSEC.

I'm passionate about learning, growing and sharpening my skills in the field. New technologies like Machine Learning and Data science always fascinate me and what better way to explore them than an opportunity to work with them!

Iâ€™m looking for internships and freelance roles in backend software development (Java & Python) and web development. 
Feel free to email me for any opportunities!
